# Face-Detection-Streamlit-APP
I used Streamlit which is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to 
create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. 
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, 
Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a 
cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to 
detect objects in other images.
